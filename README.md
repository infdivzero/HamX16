# HamX16
To compile, use whatever compiler you prefer. This hasn't been tested on other platforms besides Windows and compiled with MinGW using Eclipse. HamX16 also requires SDL2: https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

To assemble .b16 files, the B16A (Bacon-16 Assembler) is required. Follow its instructions to produce a rom.bin file to be placed in the same folder as the emulator's executable so it can boot from it
